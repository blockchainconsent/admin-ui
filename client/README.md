# Client

The React UI works in conjuction with the Server project which serves as a proxy to backend services.

  ## Development Configuration

  The `.env` file is used at development time to specify the port on which the client application will be run ans also the port of the Server process (also running on localhost). The default ports are `3000` and `5000` respectively.
